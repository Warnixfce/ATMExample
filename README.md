# ATMExercise

Application environment:
-Microsoft Windows (in my case, Windows 11 Pro)
-Visual Studio Community 2022 (System minimun requirements are needed as well)
-Asp Net MVC >= 2.2
-Entity Framework
-NET 6.0
-SQL Server Management Studio 2019 (19.0.2)
-All resources system requirements (e.g. Visual Studio system requirementes: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/system-requirements)

Needed for testing purposes:
-In order to work correctly, please change the Data Source in the appsettings.json file when going to run the application. To do so, use the information provided by SQL Server Management Studio.
-The SQL Database script is the 'ATMscript' file. It has the database settings and some data.
-There are two created cards. One is available for using and the other one is Blocked (on purpose). Use the first one for testing:
    --Card Number: 5405730001030255
    --PIN: 1739
There are two unsuccessful longin attemps already made with this card (on purpose as well).

Feel free to test it!
